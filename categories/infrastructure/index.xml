      <description>This time I want to bring up a cool GitOps tool beside ArgoCD named FluxCD. But I won&amp;rsquo;t discuss about what it is and the comparison between ArgoCD and FluxCD just yet. Instead, I find FluxCD has a cool feature of many features it provides which I don&amp;rsquo;t find this in ArgoCD (at least as the time as I write this topic). Probably, the introduction topic of FluxCD itself is worth having later on and it&amp;rsquo;s generally similar to ArgoCD as both work in the same area for Continuous Deployment.</description>

      <title>Distribute Pods Across Nodes With topologySpreadConstraints</title>

      <description>Intro I had several works related to evenly spreading out pods across nodes in order to prevent potentially Kubernetes schedule the replicas of pods on the same node which will lead to a problem if that particular node falls over. I comprehended the case because there are some ways to schedule pods and the solution must be suitable to the environment in my case. As we might already know, Kubernetes has its own built-in mechanism to schedule a pod into a node named scheduler.</description>
