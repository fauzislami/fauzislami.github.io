      <description>Intro I had several works related to evenly spreading out pods across nodes in order to prevent potentially Kubernetes schedule the replicas of pods on the same node which will lead into a problem if that particular node falls over. I comprehended the case because there are some ways to schedule pods and the solution must be suitable with the environment in my case. As we might already know, Kubernetes has its own built-in mechanism to schedule a pod into a node named scheduler.</description>

      <description>Managing kubernetes manifest on Git or any other SCM is a common task nowadays. It makes life easier if we talk about continuous deployment. However, there is a manifest that should not be stored on SCM, it&amp;rsquo;s secret object. Secret object on Kubernetes was made to hide any sensitive data including user credentials and key. Unfortunately, secret object is not completely secure, it does not encrypt but only uses base64 encoding scheme to hide the data and it can be easily decoded.</description>

&lt;p&gt;It’s the first time for me to learn what service mesh is, how it works, and how to start the lab to deep dive on this stuff. In this article, there will be some of my notes about how to install Istio and see the visualization of some microservices that will have been monitored by Istio and I’m going to write it up now.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
