      <description>This time I want to bring up a cool GitOps tool beside ArgoCD named FluxCD. But I won&amp;rsquo;t discuss about what it is and the comparison between ArgoCD and FluxCD just yet. Instead, I find FluxCD has a cool feature of many features it provides which I don&amp;rsquo;t find this in ArgoCD (at least as the time as I write this topic). Probably, the introduction topic of FluxCD itself is worth having later on and it&amp;rsquo;s generally similar to ArgoCD as both work in the same area for Continuous Deployment.</description>
