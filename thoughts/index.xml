This post doesn&amp;rsquo;t have any tendency to judge a group of people within a certain generation. It&amp;rsquo;s actually the other way around, I&amp;rsquo;m just going to try transcribing my thoughts about settling down any stereotypes belong to a generation. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t contain not necessarily the ultimate way of solving the problem as I understand this issue is prone to bias and misperceived.</description>

      <description>Upon midst of war About a couple weeks ago, I saw a video in Instagram that filming how people from refugee camps do their daily activities.

What makes me interested, is finding them cheerful and enjoying their life even though they have to live in refugee camps for uncertain time. I know that sounds miserable yet happy to see them have a safe place to flee during the war at the same time.</description>

      <description>There was a light talk between me and one of my colleagues about trade-offs in software architecture (only touched its surface and not deep at all, lol) but that&amp;rsquo;s not the topic I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk about. Long story short, I was thinking the existence of &amp;ldquo;trade-off&amp;rdquo; in a wider scope. Do we realize that trade-offs are present in everything we do? Let&amp;rsquo;s take an interesting example, the most common and the thing that most people complain about is making everyone happy.</description>
