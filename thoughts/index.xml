      <description>Upon midst of war About a couple weeks ago, I saw a video in Instagram that filming how people from refugee camps do their daily activities. They are Syrian people who have been displaced for years due to a long civilian conflict in their country. What makes me interested, is finding them cheerful and enjoying their life even though they have to live in refugee camps for uncertain time. I know that sounds miserable yet happy to see them have a safe place to flee during the war at the same time.</description>

      <description>There was a light talk between me and one of my colleagues about trade-offs in software architecture (only touched its surface and not deep at all, lol) but that&amp;rsquo;s not the topic I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk about. Long story short, I was thinking the existence of &amp;ldquo;trade-off&amp;rdquo; in a wider scope. Do we realize that trade-offs are present in everything we do? Let&amp;rsquo;s take an interesting example, the most common and the thing that most people complain about is making everyone happy.</description>
